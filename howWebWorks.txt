What is HTTP?
    Also known as Hyper Text Protocol.
    ANS: Hyper Text Transfer Protocol is governs how clients get data from, or send data to, a server.

What is a URL?

What is DNS?
    DNS stand for Domain Name system
    ANS: Short for Domain Name System, this is a system that takes human-readable URLs and converts them into IP addresses.

What is a query string?
    a query string is the text representing an item to be searched and then posted to the server for response
    ANS: The query string allows you to pass key-value pairs into the URL, in the format ?key1=value1&key2=value2...

What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?
    GET and POST. Get is command to retrieve inform from the website and post to add information into the website
    ANS: GET - get some data from the server (most pages, search forms)
        POST - send some data to the server (pages that change data on server)

What is an HTTP request?
    request represent the comment that is sent to the site to perform cetain task
    ANS: An HTTP request is a request from a client to a server which follows the HTTP protocol (eg a request for HTML from news.google.com)

What is an HTTP response?
    response is the set of codes as response by website based on the request sent
    ANS: An HTTP response is a response from a server to a client which follows the HTTP protocol (eg sending back HTML/CSS/JS/etc)

What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.
    header usually contains the status of the site, usually 200 represents response is ok. can be located by pressting CTRL+I, under network, click any response and view header
    ANS: Headers provide additional information about the request or the response. Here are some examples:
        Request headers: Host, User-Agent, Accept, Cookie, Cache-Control
        Response headers: Content-Type, Last-Modified, Set-Cookie, Cache-Control
        What happens when you type a URL in a browser?
        Your browser “resolves” the name into an IP address using DNS
        Your browser makes a request to that IP address, including headers (info about browser, any previous cookies, and other things)
        The server sends a response (typically, HTML, with a status code (200 if it was sucessful)
        The browser makes a DOM from that HTML, and finds any other resources needed (images, CSS, JavaScript, etc)
        The browser makes separate HTTP requests for those resources and receives response from the server for each
